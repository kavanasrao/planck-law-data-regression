# Black Body Radiation Analysis

# Overview
This repository contains an end-to-end project that combines knowledge of physics and coding to analyze black body radiation data based on Planck's Law. The project involves developing a machine learning model to analyze the data, connecting to a MySQL database for data retrieval, and visualizing the results using Python.
